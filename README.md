Recollection on notebooks used for the challenge Google Quest [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge) and explained in UPM AI Master Thesis

**Disclaimer:** several parts of the code come from different public notebooks published during the competition (referenced at the beginning of the notebook), causing the code styling to be heterogeneous and, sometimes, far from PEP8. No effort was put into refactoring code as it was not the goal from the competition nor the thesis work.
